Javascript snippets I wrote while learning selenium javascript API with node.js

To run selenium JS examples from this repo, you must:

1) Install and configure nodeJS on your local machine
2) Download and run Selenium Server JAR file (e.g. - selenium-server-standalone-3.6.0.jar) - https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
3) Download browser driver (e.g. for Chrome - chromedriver_win32.zip and unzip it within your code's path) - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Look, how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW0q2KCh4m8

Good luck!
